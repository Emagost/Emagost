ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a Bachelor of Systems student passionate about software development. My journey started with a course at Coderhood, igniting my interest in becoming a self-learner, using logical thinking for problem-solving, and exploring emerging technologies.

ðŸ’¼In addition to my academic activities, I currently work at Scale AI, where I perfect my skills in various technologies, such as Node.js, React, and JavaScript/TypeScript. This dynamic environment presents a lot of challenges, pushing me to continuously push myself to improve myself and adhere to best practices in software development.

ðŸš€ I thrive on challenges and always push myself to self-improvement, learning and applying best practices in all my projects - feel free to browse my repositories to see the work I'm excited about! ðŸ‘€
